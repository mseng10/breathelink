breathelink
===========

A sphinx extension that creates a new directive to simultaneously call the
breathe_ `doxygenclass` directive and a doxylink_ role to import doxygen class
documentation and create a link to the full class documentation.  The new
directive `breathelink` also creates an index entry.
